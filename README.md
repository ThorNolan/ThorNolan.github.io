My Portfolio Page
===================================================
A portfolio page I made that demonstrates some of my skills as a web developer and provides a centralized location for looking at my projects and linking to my various social media accounts. It also includes a form for easy way to get in touch with me via email.

## Technologies Used
+ Page elements and styling were done with *HTML5* and *CSS3*, with a bit of *Javascript* for initialization as well.

+ I utilized the *Materialize.css* framework for built-in components, stylings and added responsiveness. I opted for the CDN rather than downloading the minified css into my root directory. 
  
+ This page uses the *jQuery* library as it is utilized by some of the built-in Materialize features. 

+ Icons are from Font-awesome and Google Material Icons.
