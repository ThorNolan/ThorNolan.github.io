My Portfolio
===================================================
A portfolio page I made that demonstrates some of my skills as a web developer and provides a centralized location for looking at my projects and their associated deployed and Github repository links, as well as links to my LinkedIn, Github and my email for getting in touch with me.

## Technologies Used
+ Page elements and styling were done with **HTML5** and **CSS3**, with a bit of **Javascript** for initialization as well.

+ I utilized the **Materialize.css** framework for built-in components, stylings and added responsiveness. I opted for the CDN rather than downloading the minified css into my root directory. 
  
+ This page uses the **jQuery** library as it is utilized by some of the built-in Materialize features. 

+ Icons are from **Font-awesome** and **Google Material Icons**.

## Plans for the Future

+ As I continue to complete more projects they will be added to my projects section!

+ Refine my about me section to include a better breakdown of my skill-sets with more details (delineated into front-end skills, back-end skills, other skills, etc.). 

+ Some CSS animations for a couple sections to make it just a little flashier. 
   
+ Option to choose between a light/dark theme for the page.
