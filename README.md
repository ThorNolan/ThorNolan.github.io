My Portfolio Page
===================================================
A portfolio page I made that demonstrates some of my skills as a web developer and provides a centralized location for looking at my projects and linking to my various social media accounts. It also includes a form for easy way to get in touch with me via email.

## Technologies Used
+ Page elements and styling were done with *HTML5* and *CSS3*, with a bit of *Javascript* for initialization as well.

+ I utilized the *Materialize.css* framework for built-in components, stylings and added responsiveness. I opted for the CDN rather than downloading the minified css into my root directory. 
  
+ This page uses the *jQuery* library as it is utilized by some of the built-in Materialize features. 

+ Gmail icon source: <div>Icons made by <a href="https://www.freepik.com/" title="Freepik">Freepik</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" 			    title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" 			    title="Creative Commons BY 3.0" target="_blank">CC 3.0 BY</a></div>
